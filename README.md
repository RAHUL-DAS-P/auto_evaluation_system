### Description
The Auto Grading System is designed to streamline the educational assessment process by automating the grading of test answers using advanced machine learning models. This project, developed by students of the College of Engineering Trivandrum for the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, focuses on improving the efficiency and integrity of educational evaluations.

### Features
- **Test Assessment:** Automatically grades student responses using machine learning.
- **Plagiarism Identification:** Checks for uniqueness to ensure academic integrity.
- **Student Performance History:** Tracks and analyzes student performance over time.
- **Feedback Emails:** Sends personalized feedback directly to students.

### Technologies
- **Flask:** For the web application serving the grading interface.
- **Tesseract OCR:** Integrates Optical Character Recognition for analyzing scanned answer sheets.
- **AllMiniLLM:** Utilizes advanced NLP models for semantic analysis and grading accuracy.
